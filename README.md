# Hey there!  I'm Faiaj

### Backend & AI Engineer

I love diving deep into the architecture of modern applications. I work primarily in **Python**, **Golang**, and **JavaScript**, but I'm a pragmatist at heart  always happy to use whatever tool is best suited for the problem at hand.

Over the last 1.5 years of writing production-ready code, exploring **System Design** and **Distributed Systems** has become a daily habit. My two favorite daily activities are learning and teaching within my team, and listening to Vampire Weekend (or good lo-fi beats) while I jam out complex backend logic.

###  What I'm currently focused on

Lately, I've been on a massive **AI engineering** kick. When I have free time, I'm usually building:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines** and context-aware LLM tools.
- **Autonomous AI agents** capable of executing complex workflows.
- High-throughput **data pipelines** and **microservices** designed to serve intelligent models reliably at scale.
